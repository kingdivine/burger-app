Containers are just stateful components

For arrow functions, use curly braces if doing any logic, 
parentheses if just returning something

dont determine whether or not your component is a container 
(is stateful) by whether or not its a class. all 
components can be created as classes its just good practice
to have most as functions

in BuildControls.js the key is used for each build control is the label
as this is a unique identifier. there will not be another
buildcontrol with the same label

can have css classes with the same name in different files (modules)
as they are converted to scoped names. eg a logo class module,
a logo class in toolbar and a logo class in sidedrawer

to pass a boolean prop to a component, can just pass prop name if true

wrapping elements control the updating of wrapped elements. clicking 
more or less changes state.ingredients. order summary component uses it this
so is re rendered everytime even though we dont need to show it. we use 
component should update in the wrapping component (modal) to only update 
if it needs to be shown (props.show is true)

The <></> syntax does not accept attributes, including keys.
If keyed fragment needed can use <Fragment />, import Fragment
just like component

Routing is not part of the standard React library. We will add a router package that
parses URL/Path, read the config, then render the right jsx

even if router is used at app level only components loaded directly through a route
(eg in component attribute of <Route>) have access to axios' history and match 
location props. can use withRouter HOC on component to get round this 


REDUX

With redux, if the state of a component is not relevant to the whole
app, just use local state


An action is just a js object with a type(usually all caps), and a payload
(called whatever you want)

A reducer takes previous state and an action and returns a new state
